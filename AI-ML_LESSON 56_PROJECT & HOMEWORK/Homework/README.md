Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a quantum random number generator using Qiskit and classical machine learning techniques.

Overview
The project consists of the following components:

Quantum circuit for generating random numbers.
Data collection module to gather the outcomes of the quantum circuit.
Classical machine learning model to analyze the randomness of the generated numbers.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Qiskit
NumPy
Scikit-learn

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-random-number-generator.git

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the main script:

python random_number_generator.py
The script will output statistical metrics such as mean, variance, and mean squared error (MSE) to analyze the randomness of the generated numbers.
