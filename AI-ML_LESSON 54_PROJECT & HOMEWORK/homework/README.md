Weather Forecasting using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast rainfall based on weather data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It involves generating dummy weather data, visualizing weather trends, training a Random Forest model, and evaluating its performance in predicting rainfall.

## Concepts Covered
Data Generation
Data Visualization
Machine Learning (Random Forest Regression)
Model Evaluation
Weather Forecasting

## Required Libraries
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

## Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

## How to Run
Open the weather_forecasting_using_machine_learning.py file in your Python environment.
Run the script.

## Output
The script will generate sample weather data and display visualizations of temperature variation, humidity variation, wind speed variation, and rainfall distribution. It will then train a Random Forest model, make predictions on test data, and evaluate the model's performance by calculating the mean squared error. Finally, it will plot the actual vs predicted rainfall.
