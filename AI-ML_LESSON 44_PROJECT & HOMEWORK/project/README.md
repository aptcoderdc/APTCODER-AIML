Generating Handwritten Digits with GANs

## Overview
This project aims to generate fake handwritten digits using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework.

## Concepts Covered
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Deep Learning
Neural Networks
Data Preprocessing
Model Training
Model Evaluation

## Required Libraries
NumPy
Matplotlib
TensorFlow
Keras

## Setup
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras

Navigate to the project directory:

cd generating-handwritten-digits-gans

## How to Run
Open the project directory in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
Run the generating_handwritten_digits_with_gans.py script.
The script will train the GAN model to generate fake handwritten digits.
After training, the script will generate and display fake handwritten digits using the trained model.
