# Sandwich Making Activity


## Introduction
This Python program simulates a sandwich-making activity where kids can experiment with adjusting the quantities of ingredients to create their own sandwiches. The activity is designed to introduce the concept of hyperparameters in a fun and interactive way.


## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `sandwich_activity.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the `sandwich_activity.py` file is located.
5. Run the program by executing the command: `python sandwich_activity.py`.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to create and evaluate sandwiches.


## Instructions
1. **Baseline Sandwich:** The program starts by creating a baseline sandwich with default quantities of ingredients.
2. **Evaluation:** After making the baseline sandwich, the program prompts the user to rate it based on taste, texture, and overall satisfaction.
3. **Sandwich Tuning:** Users can then adjust the quantities of ingredients to create their own sandwiches.
4. **Evaluation of Tuned Sandwich:** After making the tuned sandwich, the program prompts the user to rate it based on taste, texture, and overall satisfaction.
5. **Comparison:** Finally, the program compares the ratings of the baseline and tuned sandwiches.


## Example Usage




Welcome to the Sandwich Making Activity!
Let's start by making a baseline sandwich...
Making a sandwich with the following ingredients:
Bread slices: 2
Cheese slices: 1
Lettuce leaves: 1
Tomato slices: 2
Please rate the sandwich based on taste, texture, and overall satisfaction (1 to 5):
Taste: 4
Texture: 5
Overall satisfaction: 4
Now, let's experiment with tuning the sandwich!
Adjust the quantities of ingredients to create your own sandwich.
Sandwich Tuning:
Enter the number of bread slices: 2
Enter the number of cheese slices: 2
Enter the number of lettuce leaves: 2
Enter the number of tomato slices: 2
Making a sandwich with the following ingredients:
Bread slices: 2
Cheese slices: 2
Lettuce leaves: 2
Tomato slices: 2
Please rate the sandwich based on taste, texture, and overall satisfaction (1 to 5):
Taste: 5
Texture: 4
Overall satisfaction: 5
Comparison of Ratings:
Baseline Sandwich Ratings: (4, 5, 4)
Tuned Sandwich Ratings: (5, 4, 5)
