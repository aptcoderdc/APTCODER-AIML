## Overview:

 This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It analyzes movie reviews and predicts whether they are positive or negative.

## Concepts Covered:

Building a sentiment analysis model using LSTM networks.
Tokenizing characters and preparing input sequences for training.
Training the model to classify reviews as positive or negative.

## Required Libraries:

numpy
tensorflow

## Setup:

Install Python if not already installed.
Install required libraries using pip: pip install numpy tensorflow
Save the project files (sentiment_analysis_with_long_short-term_memory_networks.py and README.md) in a directory.

## How to Run:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the project files are saved.
Run the Python script: python sentiment_analysis_with_long_short-term_memory_networks.py
The script will train the model and display the training progress.
After training, the model will be ready for sentiment analysis.

## Note: You can modify the positive_reviews and negative_reviews variables to add your own reviews for analysis.
