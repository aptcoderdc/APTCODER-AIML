# Simple Dimensionality Reduction with PCA Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Python. It generates random 2D data, applies PCA to reduce it to 1 dimension, and visualizes the original and reduced-dimensional data using matplotlib.

## Setup and Requirements
Before running the project, ensure the following setup and requirements:
- Python installed on your system
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed
- Basic understanding of Python programming

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt:

3. Install the required libraries:

pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn


## Usage
1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code:
- Launch VS Code.
- Click on "File" > "Open Folder" and select the project folder.
2. Open the `pca_project.py` file.
3. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + S`.
4. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code:
- Click on "Terminal" > "New Terminal".
5. Run the Python file:
6. View the output in the terminal, which will display the original and reduced-dimensional data plotted using matplotlib.
