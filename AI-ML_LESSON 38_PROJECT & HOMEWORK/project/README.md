## AI in Healthcare - Disease Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning in healthcare for disease prediction.

## Overview
In this project, we build a simple disease prediction model using dummy healthcare data. The model predicts the presence or absence of a disease based on features such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol level.

## Concepts Covered
Machine Learning
Classification
Random Forest Classifier
Model Evaluation

## Required Libraries
NumPy
scikit-learn

## Setup
Install the required libraries: pip install numpy scikit-learn
Download or clone the project files.

## How to Run
Open the disease_prediction.py file in VS code.
Run the script by command python 'file_name'

## Example Output

Accuracy: 1.0

This indicates the accuracy of the disease prediction model on the test data.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied in healthcare for disease prediction, which can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
