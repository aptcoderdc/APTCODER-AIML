# Image Classification with Explainable AI

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple image classification model with Explainable AI (XAI) capabilities. The model predicts the main object present in an image and provides an explanation for its prediction.

## Concepts Covered
- Image classification
- Explainable AI (XAI)
- Model explanation

## Required Libraries
- NumPy: for generating random choices
- (Optional) OpenCV: for image processing (not used in this example)

## Setup
No special setup is required. Simply run the provided Python script in an environment with NumPy installed.

## How to Run
1. Ensure that the required libraries are installed.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python script (e.g., `image_classification.py`).
3. Run the script.
