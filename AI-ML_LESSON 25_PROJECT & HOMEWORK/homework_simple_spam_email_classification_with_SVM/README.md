# Simple Spam Email Classification with SVM 

This project is a homework assignment for implementing a simple spam email classification system using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Overview

The homework project involves implementing a Python script that utilizes the scikit-learn library to build an SVM classifier for classifying emails as spam or non-spam (ham).

## Setup and Requirements

Before running the project, ensure the following setup and requirements:

- Python installed on your system
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed
- Basic understanding of Python programming

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt:


## Usage
