# Text Classification with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

This homework assignment demonstrates how to perform text classification using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In this example, we'll classify text messages into spam and ham (non-spam) categories.

## Overview

This project uses a simple LSTM-based neural network to learn patterns in text messages and classify them as either spam or ham.

## Concepts Covered

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Text classification

## Required Libraries

- numpy
- TensorFlow (install with `pip install tensorflow`)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Run the provided Python script (`text_classification_rnn.py`) in your Python environment.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script:


## Output

The model training process will print the loss and accuracy metrics for each epoch.

## Additional Notes

- Adjust the `seq_length` variable to change the length of the input sequences.
- Modify the `spam_messages` and `ham_messages` variables to use different input text data for classification.
