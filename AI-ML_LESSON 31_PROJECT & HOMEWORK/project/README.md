## Overview

In this project, we'll explore techniques to handle imbalanced datasets using a Random Forest classifier. Imbalanced datasets are datasets where the distribution of classes is skewed, leading to challenges in model training and evaluation.

## Concepts Covered

Generating an imbalanced dataset
Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
Training a Random Forest classifier
Evaluating model performance using classification report

## Required Libraries

NumPy
scikit-learn

## Setup

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:

--> pip install numpy scikit-learn

## How to Run

Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Open the project directory in VS Code.
Open the handling_imbalanced_datasets_project.py file.
Run the script.

## Additional Information

The make_classification function from sklearn.datasets is used to generate the imbalanced dataset.
The RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble is used as the model.
The classification_report from sklearn.metrics is used to evaluate the model's performance.
