# AI-Powered Image Classifier

## Overview
The AI-Powered Image Classifier is a project that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to classify images of fruits. Users can provide queries in natural language to request images of fruits, and the system will use computer vision techniques to identify the fruits in the provided images.

## Concepts Covered
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Tokenization
- Stopword Removal
- Computer Vision
- Image Classification
- Dummy Data Generation
- Random Selection (for demonstration purposes)

## Required Libraries
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for NLP processing
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) for image processing
- NumPy for numerical computations

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install nltk opencv-python numpy

3. Download NLTK resources by running the following commands in Python:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

## How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run the main script:

python ai_powered_image_classifier.py
Follow the prompts to interact with the Image Classifier.

## Example Usage
Text Query: "Show me pictures of fruits"
Processed Query: ['show', 'pictures', 'fruits']
Identified Fruit: orange

## Future Directions
Enhance the image classification model for better accuracy.
Expand the dataset to include more fruits and diverse images.
Integrate with web or mobile applications for real-time image classification.
