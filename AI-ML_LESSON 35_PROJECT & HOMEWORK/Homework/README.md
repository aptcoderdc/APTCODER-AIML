# Shape Segmentation Project

This project is a simple image segmentation project that generates synthetic images of shapes (circles, squares, and triangles) along with their corresponding masks.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib

Copy code

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/shape-segmentation-project.git



2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd shape-segmentation-project



3. Run the main script:

python main.py


4. You will see synthetic images of shapes along with their corresponding masks displayed in a matplotlib window.

## Customization

You can customize the project by modifying the parameters in the `main.py` file. For example, you can change the number of samples generated or the size of the images.
