# Basic Data Compression with Autoencoders Homework

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of data compression using Autoencoders in Python. It includes sample grayscale image data, flattens the images, defines an autoencoder architecture with one hidden layer, and performs a forward pass to compress and reconstruct the images.

## Setup and Requirements
Before running the project, ensure the following setup and requirements:
- Python installed on your system
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed
- Basic understanding of Python programming

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt:


## Usage
1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code:
- Launch VS Code.
- Click on "File" > "Open Folder" and select the project folder.
1. Open the file.
2. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + S`.
3. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code:
- Click on "Terminal" > "New Terminal".
1. Run the Python file:

2. View the output in the terminal, which will display the original and reconstructed images.
