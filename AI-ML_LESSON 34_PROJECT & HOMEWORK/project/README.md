This project demonstrates building a basic sentiment analysis model using Naive Bayes classifier. It takes a set of positive and negative sentences, converts them into numerical format using CountVectorizer, and then trains the model on the data. Finally, it evaluates the model's accuracy on a test set.

## Overview:

Objective: To classify sentences as positive or negative based on their sentiment.
Algorithm: Naive Bayes classifier.

Dataset: A small dataset of positive and negative sentences.

## Setup:
Install the required libraries: numpy, scikit-learn.
Download or clone the project repository.

## Usage:
Run the sentiment_analysis_with_naive_bayes.py script.
The script will train the model, make predictions on a test set, and print the accuracy.
