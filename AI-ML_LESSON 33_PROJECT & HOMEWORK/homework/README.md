## Overview:

 This homework project focuses on sequence prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It predicts future weather temperatures based on past temperature data.

## Concepts Covered:

Building a sequence prediction model using LSTM networks.
Preparing input sequences for training and predicting future values.

## Required Libraries:

numpy
tensorflow

## Setup:

Install Python if not already installed.
Install required libraries using pip: pip install numpy tensorflow
Save the homework script (sequence_prediction_with_lstms.py) and README.md file in a directory.

## How to Run:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the homework script is saved.
Run the Python script: python sequence_prediction_with_lstms.py
The script will train the model to predict future weather temperatures based on past data.
After training, the model will be ready for predicting future temperatures.
