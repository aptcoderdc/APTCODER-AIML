# Text Generation with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

This project demonstrates how to generate text using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In this example, we'll generate text based on the input string "hello world".

## Overview

This project uses a simple LSTM-based neural network to learn patterns in the input text data and generate new text based on the learned patterns.

## Concepts Covered

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Text generation

## Required Libraries

- numpy
- TensorFlow (install with `pip install tensorflow`)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Run the provided Python script (`text_generation_rnn.py`) in your Python environment.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script:



## Output

The generated text will be printed to the console.


## Additional Notes

- Adjust the `seq_length` variable to change the length of the input sequences.
- Modify the `text` variable to use a different input string for text generation.
