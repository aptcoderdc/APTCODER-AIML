Project: Detecting Bias in AI Systems

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a simple bias detection algorithm for AI systems. Bias in AI systems can lead to unfair outcomes and discrimination. Understanding and mitigating bias is crucial for developing ethical and equitable AI solutions.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how bias can be detected in AI systems using a simple example. By detecting bias, developers can take steps to mitigate it and ensure fair and ethical AI practices.

## Concepts Covered
Bias detection in AI systems
Understanding and recognizing bias
Using probability distributions to simulate bias detection

## Required Libraries
NumPy: For generating random data and performing computations

## Setup
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy

## How to Run
Clone or download the project repository.
Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
Run the detect_bias_in_ai.py file.

## Example Output

Bias Detected in AI System: Female

This indicates that the bias detection algorithm detected a bias towards females in the AI system's predictions.
