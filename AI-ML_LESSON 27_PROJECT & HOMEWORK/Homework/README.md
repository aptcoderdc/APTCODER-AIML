 # Grouping Similar Animals


## Introduction
This project aims to group similar animals based on their characteristics using unsupervised learning techniques. It provides an interactive way for kids to explore clustering algorithms and understand how data can be grouped together based on similarities.


## Objective
The main objective of this project is to introduce kids to the concept of unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms. Through this project, they will learn how to:
- Collect and preprocess data
- Perform clustering using K-means algorithm
- Visualize clustering results
- Interpret the grouped animals based on their characteristics


## Tools Required
- Python (with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for easy visualization)


## Project Structure
- `animal_clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project.
- `data.csv`: Sample dataset containing information about animals and their characteristics.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.


## Instructions
1. Install Python and required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn).
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Open the `animal_clustering.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and visualize the clustering results.
5. Experiment with different clustering algorithms and parameters to see how it affects the results.
6. Discuss and interpret the results with the kids, encouraging them to understand how animals are grouped based on similarities.
