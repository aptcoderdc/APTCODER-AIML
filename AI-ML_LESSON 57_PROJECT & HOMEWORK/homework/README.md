Quantum-inspired Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Overview
This project implements a quantum-inspired version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. In this game, the player competes against a quantum computer, which makes its choice based on random quantum principles. The game follows the standard rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.

## Concepts Covered
Object-oriented programming in Python
Random number generation
Conditional statements
User input

## Required Libraries
Random (built-in)

## Setup
No special setup is required for this project.

## How to Run
Download the QuantumRockPaperScissors.py file to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the QuantumRockPaperScissors.py file.
Run the script using the following command:

python QuantumRockPaperScissors.py

## Usage
The game will prompt you to enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
Once you enter your choice, the quantum computer will randomly generate its choice.
The game will then determine the winner based on the choices made by you and the quantum computer.
The winner will be displayed, or if it's a tie, the game will indicate so.

## Example

Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors): Rock
You win!
