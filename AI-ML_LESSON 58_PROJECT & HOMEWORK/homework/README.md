Traffic Light Control Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the behavior of a traffic light, cycling through the colors red, green, and yellow. It demonstrates the basic functionality of traffic lights and their role in controlling traffic flow.

## Concepts Covered
Object-oriented programming in Python
Simulation of traffic light behavior
Time-based control of traffic light changes

## Required Libraries
Python (>=3.6)
Time (built-in)

## Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## How to Run
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command:

python traffic_light_simulation.py

## Output
The program will display the color of the traffic light (red, green, or yellow) and change the color every 3 seconds, simulating the behavior of a real traffic light.

## Example

Traffic Light Color: Red
Traffic Light Color: Green
Traffic Light Color: Yellow
Traffic Light Color: Red
Traffic Light Color: Green
