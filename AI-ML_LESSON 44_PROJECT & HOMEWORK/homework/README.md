Modifying GAN for Fashion Item Generation

## Overview
This homework assignment involves modifying a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate fake fashion items using the Fashion MNIST dataset. GANs are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework.

## Concepts Covered
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Deep Learning
Neural Networks
Data Preprocessing
Model Training
Model Evaluation

## Required Libraries
NumPy
Matplotlib
TensorFlow
Keras

## Setup
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras

Navigate to the project directory:

cd modifying-gan-for-fashion-item-generation

## How to Run
Open the project directory in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
Run the modifying_gan_for_fashion_item_generation.py script.
The script will train the modified GAN model to generate fake fashion items using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
After training, the script will generate and display fake fashion items using the trained model.
