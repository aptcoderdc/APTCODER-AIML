Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

## Overview
This homework demonstrates time series forecasting using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. It generates synthetic time series data and trains an LSTM model to predict the next value in the series based on the current value.

## Concepts Covered
Generating synthetic time series data
Building an LSTM model for time series forecasting
Training the model and visualizing training loss
Comparing actual vs predicted time series

## Required Libraries
numpy
matplotlib
tensorflow

## Setup
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow

## How to Run
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the time_series_forecasting_lstm.py script using Python:

python time_series_forecasting_lstm.py

## Example Output
The homework will display two plots:

Training Loss: Shows the loss value during training epochs.
Actual vs Predicted Time Series: Compares the actual time series data with the predicted values generated by the LSTM model.
