## Overview:
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Concepts Covered:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Image Classification
TensorFlow and Keras

## Required Libraries:
numpy
tensorflow

## Setup:
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from Python's official website.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy tensorflow

## How to Run:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
Run the following command to execute the Python script:

python handwritten_digit_recognition.py

## Output:
The script will train a CNN model on the MNIST dataset and evaluate its performance on the test set. It will print the test loss and accuracy of the model.

## Example Output:

Test loss: 0.036
Test accuracy: 0.989
