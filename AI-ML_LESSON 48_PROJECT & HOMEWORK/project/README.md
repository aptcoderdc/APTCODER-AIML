Time Series Forecasting with Simple Neural Network

## Overview
This project demonstrates time series forecasting using a simple neural network. It generates synthetic time series data and trains a neural network to predict the next value in the series based on the current value.

## Concepts Covered
Generating synthetic time series data
Building a simple neural network model
Training the model for time series forecasting
Visualizing training loss and predictions

## Required Libraries
numpy
matplotlib
tensorflow

## Setup
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow

## How to Run
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the time_series_forecasting.py script using Python:

python time_series_forecasting.py

## Example Output

The project will display two plots:

Training Loss: Shows the loss value during training epochs.
Actual vs Predicted Time Series: Compares the actual time series data with the predicted values generated by the neural network.
