Image Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Project Overview

This project aims to build a simple image classification system using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We will use a dataset of handwritten digits, such as the MNIST dataset, for this project. The goal is to train an SVM model to accurately classify images of handwritten digits into their respective classes (0-9).

1. Dataset Preparation:
Load the dataset of handwritten digits.
Preprocess the data if necessary, such as flattening the images and scaling the pixel values.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Model Development:
Build an SVM model using Scikit-learn's SVC class.
Experiment with different kernels (linear, polynomial, radial basis function) and parameters to find the best model.
Train the model on the training data.

3. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.
Visualize the model's performance metrics and confusion matrix to gain insights into its strengths and weaknesses.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search to further optimize the model's performance.

5. Conclusion:
Summarize the findings from model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
Discuss potential areas for improvement or future work.
