# Robot Maze Runner - Reinforcement Learning Basics

## Description
This project is designed to teach the basics of reinforcement learning to kids by implementing a simple program where a virtual robot learns to navigate through a maze to reach a goal. The robot learns using the Q-learning algorithm.

## Features
- Maze environment with walls, a start point, and a goal.
- Q-learning algorithm implementation.
- Visualization of robot navigation through the maze.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow library

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/robot-maze-runner.git
cd robot-maze-runner


2. Install required dependencies:
pip install tensorflow



## Usage
1. Run the main script:
python robot_maze_runner.py


2. Follow the prompts to visualize the robot's navigation through the maze.

## File Structure
- `robot_maze_runner.py`: Main Python script implementing the Q-learning algorithm and robot navigation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `maze.npy`: Numpy file containing the maze layout.
- Other files (if any): Additional resources or scripts used in the project.
