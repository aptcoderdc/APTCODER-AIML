# Model Slimming Techniques Project

This project explores model slimming techniques to reduce the size and complexity of a decision tree classifier model using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to slim down a decision tree classifier model using the following techniques:

1. **Pruning:** Simplifying the decision tree by removing less significant branches to reduce model complexity.
2. **Quantization:** Reducing the precision of model parameters (node values) to lower bit-width integers.

## Project Structure

- `slimming.py`: Python script containing the implementation of model slimming techniques.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Text file listing the required dependencies for the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your_username/model-slimming-project.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd model-slimming-project
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the slimming.py script to execute the model slimming techniques.

python slimming.py
Results
The script will print the accuracy of the original model and the pruned model after slimming.
