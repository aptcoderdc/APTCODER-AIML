# Homework: Image Classification with Custom Model

This homework assignment demonstrates how to create a custom image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview
Image classification is a task of categorizing images into predefined classes or categories. In this homework, we'll create a simple custom model to classify images into two classes.

## Concepts Covered
- Custom model creation
- ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation
- Training a model with dummy data

## Required Libraries
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Setup
1. Ensure that you have TensorFlow and Keras installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras


2. Create a directory named `dummy_data_directory` and place some dummy images inside it. The images can be any random images as we are not using actual training data.

## How to Run
1. Open the `image_classification_with_custom_model.py` file in your preferred Python environment.

2. Run the script.

## Output
The script will train the custom image classification model using the dummy data and print the training progress.
