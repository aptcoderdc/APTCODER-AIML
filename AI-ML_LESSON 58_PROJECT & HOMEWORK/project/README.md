Autonomous Vehicle Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the movement of autonomous vehicles in an environment with obstacles. The vehicles dynamically adjust their speed and change lanes to avoid obstacles, demonstrating basic concepts of autonomous vehicle behavior.

## Concepts Covered
Object-oriented programming in Python
Simulation of vehicle movement and obstacle avoidance
Dynamic speed adjustment and lane changing behavior

## Required Libraries
Python (>=3.6)
Random (built-in)
Time (built-in)

## Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install random
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## How to Run
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command:

python autonomous_vehicle_simulation.py

## Output
The program will display the simulation of autonomous vehicles moving in an environment with obstacles. It will print messages indicating whether a vehicle is accelerating, decelerating, or changing lanes based on the presence of obstacles.
