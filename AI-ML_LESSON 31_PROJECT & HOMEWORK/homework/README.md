## Overview

In this homework, we'll evaluate the performance of a model trained on an imbalanced dataset using evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Concepts Covered

Computing confusion matrix
Calculating precision, recall, and F1-score

## Required Libraries

NumPy
scikit-learn

## Setup

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip:

--> pip install numpy scikit-learn

## How to Run

Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Open the project directory in VS Code.
Open the handling_imbalanced_datasets_evaluation.py file.
Run the script.

## Additional Information

The confusion_matrix function from sklearn.metrics is used to compute the confusion matrix.
The precision_score, recall_score, and f1_score functions from sklearn.metrics are used to calculate precision, recall, and F1-score respectively.
