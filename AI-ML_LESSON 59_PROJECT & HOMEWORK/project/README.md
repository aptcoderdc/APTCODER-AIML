# AI-Powered Smart Shopping Assistant

## Overview
The AI-Powered Smart Shopping Assistant is a project that combines natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to assist users in their shopping experience. The system allows users to interact using text queries and images to find relevant products and obtain information about them.

## Concepts Covered
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Tokenization
- Stopword Removal
- Computer Vision
- Image Processing
- Product Identification
- Random Selection (for demonstration purposes)

## Required Libraries
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for NLP processing
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) for image processing
- NumPy for numerical computations

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install nltk opencv-python numpy

3. Download NLTK resources by running the following commands in Python:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

## How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run the main script:

python ai_powered_shopping_assistant.py

## Follow the prompts to interact with the Smart Shopping Assistant.
Example Usage
Text Query: "I need a smartphone"
Processed Query: ['need', 'smartphone']
Identified Product: iphone
Product Details: {'category': 'electronics', 'price': 999, 'description': 'Smartphone from Apple'}
Image Query: Upload an image of a product
Identified Product: book
Product Details: {'category': 'books', 'price': 20, 'description': 'Bestselling novel'}

## Future Directions
Implement more advanced NLP techniques for query understanding.
Enhance computer vision capabilities for better product identification.
Integrate with e-commerce platforms for real-time product information.
