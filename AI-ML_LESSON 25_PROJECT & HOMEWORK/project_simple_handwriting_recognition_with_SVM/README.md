# Simple Handwriting Recognition with SVM Project

This project demonstrates simple handwriting recognition using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Overview

The project utilizes the scikit-learn library to implement an SVM model for recognizing handwritten digits.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following requirements installed:
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:


2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:


## How to Run

1. **Open VS Code**: Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

2. **Open Project**: Open the project directory in VS Code.

3. **Run the Python File**: Open the file in VS Code and run it.

4. **View Output**: After running the Python file, you should see the accuracy of the SVM model in recognizing handwritten digits displayed in the terminal.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors during setup or execution, make sure you have correctly installed Python and the required libraries.
