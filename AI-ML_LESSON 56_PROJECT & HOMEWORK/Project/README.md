Quantum Coin Flip

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a quantum coin flip using Qiskit and classical machine learning techniques.

Overview
The project consists of the following components:

Quantum circuit for simulating a coin flip.
Data collection module to gather coin flip outcomes.
Classical machine learning model to predict the outcome based on quantum circuit parameters.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Qiskit
NumPy
Scikit-learn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-coin-flip.git

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the main script:

python coin_flip.py
The script will output the accuracy of the machine learning model in predicting coin flip outcomes.
