# Simple Image Segmentation with U-Net

This project demonstrates a basic image segmentation task using the U-Net architecture. It generates synthetic images of circles, squares, and triangles, along with corresponding masks, and visualizes them.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-segmentation.git
cd image-segmentation
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Python script:


python image_segmentation.py
This script generates synthetic images and masks, visualizes them, and saves the results in the output directory.
