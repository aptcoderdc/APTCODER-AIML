# Object Detection with YOLO

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple object detection implementation using YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. YOLO is a popular object detection algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy.

## Concepts Covered
- Object Detection
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- Bounding Box Detection
- Dummy Data Generation

## Required Libraries
- NumPy

## Setup
 Install the required libraries:
   
   pip install numpy

## How to Run

Clone the repository:

Navigate to the project directory

Run the Python script

## Usage
The detect_objects(image) function takes an image array as input and returns a list of detected objects along with their labels and bounding box coordinates. The dummy implementation randomly generates bounding box coordinates for the predefined set of objects.
