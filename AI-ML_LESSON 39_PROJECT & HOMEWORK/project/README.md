## AI in Finance - Investment Recommendation
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning in finance for investment recommendation.

## Overview
In this project, we build a simple investment recommendation model using dummy financial data. The model predicts whether an individual should invest based on features such as age, income, and savings.

## Concepts Covered
Machine Learning
Classification
Random Forest Classifier
Model Evaluation

## Required Libraries
NumPy
scikit-learn

## Setup
Install the required libraries: pip install numpy scikit-learn
Download or clone the project files.

## How to Run
Open the investment_recommendation.py file in your Python environment.
Run the script by running command python file_name

## Example Output

Accuracy: 1.0
This indicates the accuracy of the investment recommendation model on the test data.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied in finance for investment recommendation, which can assist individuals in making informed financial decisions.
