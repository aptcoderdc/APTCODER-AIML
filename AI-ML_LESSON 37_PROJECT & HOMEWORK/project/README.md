# Project: Image Classification with Pre-trained Model

This project demonstrates how to perform image classification using a pre-trained VGG16 model.

## Overview
Image classification is a task of categorizing images into predefined classes or categories. Pre-trained models, such as VGG16, have been trained on large datasets and can be used to classify images with high accuracy.

## Concepts Covered
- Image classification
- Pre-trained models
- VGG16 architecture
- Image preprocessing

## Required Libraries
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Setup
1. Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras

2. Download any image as example (`example_image.jpg`) or use your own image for classification.

## How to Run
1. Open the `image_classification_with_pre_trained_model.py` file in your preferred Python environment.

2. Run the script by 'python image_classification_with_pre_trained_model.py'

## Output
The script will classify the provided image and print the top 3 predictions along with their confidence scores.

## Note
Ensure that you have a stable internet connection when running the script for the first time, as it needs to download the pre-trained VGG16 model weights.
