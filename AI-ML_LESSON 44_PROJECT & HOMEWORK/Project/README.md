# Sentiment Analysis with Transformers

## Overview
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using pre-trained transformer models, specifically leveraging the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python. We use the BERT model for sentiment classification in this example.

## Dependencies
- Python (>= 3.6)
- transformers (>= 4.0.0)
- torch (>= 1.4.0)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install transformers torch

Dataset
For simplicity, we use a small sample dataset containing text samples with corresponding sentiment labels (0 for negative, 1 for positive). You can replace this dataset with your own data for more comprehensive analysis.

Usage
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/sentiment-analysis-transformers.git
cd sentiment-analysis-transformers
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the sentiment analysis script:


python sentiment_analysis.py

onfiguration
You can modify the following parameters in the sentiment_analysis.py script to customize the behavior:

texts: Input text samples for sentiment analysis.
labels: Corresponding sentiment labels (0 for negative, 1 for positive).
model_name: Name of the pre-trained transformer model to use (e.g., 'bert-base-uncased').
lr: Learning rate for the optimizer.
epochs: Number of training epochs.
batch_size: Batch size for training.
