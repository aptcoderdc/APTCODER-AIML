This homework extends the project by testing the trained model on new sentences to predict their sentiment.

## Overview:

Objective: To classify new sentences as positive or negative using the previously trained Naive Bayes classifier.

Dataset: The same dataset of positive and negative sentences used in the project.

## Setup:
Install the required libraries: numpy, scikit-learn.
Download or clone the project repository.

## Usage:
Run the text_classification_with_naive_bayes_homework.py script.
The script will use the previously trained model to predict the sentiment of new sentences and print the predictions.
